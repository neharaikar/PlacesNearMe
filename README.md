# PlacesNearMe
PlacesNearMe application is built on Android Studio, making use of the Google-maps API along with the Google-places API.
This app basically gives us a list of all the places related to the entry in the search bar, within a radius of 100m, 200, 500, and 1km, as per the users choice. 
It has the maps feature added to it as well.
For example, I set my radius to 100m and type food in the search bar and submit. The application will provide us with a list of all the restaurants 
and eateries along with details like: rating, opening hours, and address; within a radius of 100m to my current location. On clicking upon an item in the list, the app
displays a map locating our current location and the destination, along with a navigation button which takes us to Google maps showing us the routes to that place.
